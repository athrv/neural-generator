# neural-generator
Neural-generator is an implementation, showcasing a Wavenet-inspired extension built upon a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for character-level language modeling. The project focuses on generating text based on a given dataset of words, training the model to predict the next character in a sequence. The trained model allows the generation of new text based on the learned patterns from the dataset. Sample text generations demonstrate the model's ability to create coherent sequences of characters. For instance, we can feed it a database of names, and it will come up with some unique ideas for names that don't already exist but sound like names.
